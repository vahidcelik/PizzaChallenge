# PizzaChallenge

One of our restaurant clients wants to know which pizza topping combinations are the most popular. 

Using a language in our technical stack, write a throw-away app or script that will download orders directly from 
`http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json` and output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza topping combinations. 
List the toppings for each popular pizza topping combination along with its rank and the number of times 
that combination has been ordered.
